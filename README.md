WORK IN PROGRESS

PlatformIO Source Code for the 3D-printed Auto-Vacuum - https://makerworld.com/en/models/

Arduino Uno R4 Wifi

Attempting to design a battery powered vacuum that can:
1) Scout an area
   - Navigate its way through an unknown area.
   - Generate a complete map of the area's boundaries using feedback primarily from a motor encoder, ultrasonic range finder and compass.
   - Save this map to non-volatile memory.
2) Vacuum the entire area
   - Use the map to "plan" vacuuming the area.
   - Use the encoder & compass as the primary means of tracking its rough position on the map.
   - Use the ultrasonic range finder to deduce corrections to its position and perform more precise short term navigation around non-mapped obstacles.
